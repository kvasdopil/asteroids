# Asteroids #

A little game I wrote for a bit of self-education.

Demo: http://kvasdopil.github.com/asteroids

Note: currently the game is desktop-only.

## TODO ##
- add a scoreboard
- add a mobile version
- fix the bug with balls bouncing off the asteroids
- add a nice bg texture
- add charging/overheat to a weapon
- add a ufo
- add a pvp mode
